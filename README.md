## :arrow_up: How to Setup

**Step 1:** git clone this repository: `git clone [repo_url]`

**Step 2:** cd to the cloned repository: `cd webapp`

**Step 3:** Install the Application with `yarn`


## :arrow_forward: How to Run App

1. cd to the repo
2. Run & Build
  * Run
    * Run `yarn start`
    * View app on http://localhost:3000/
  * Build
    * Run `yarn build`
    * View `build` folder in the repository

## :closed_lock_with_key: Secrets

API keys and other sensitive information are shared privately and stored in a .env.[environment] file.

Example file: `.env.sample`
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://myapi.com
REACT_APP_API_KEY=abc12345
```

and access them from React app like so:

```
process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL
process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY
```

The `.env.[environment]` file is ignored by git keeping those secrets out of the repository.

## Run Storybook

* Run `yarn storybook`
* View storybook page on http://localhost:6006/
